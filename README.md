#### The Highway Capacity Manual defines the capacity as the maximum howdy rate at which persons or vehicles can be reasonably expected to traverse a point or a uniform segment of a lane or roadway during a given period, under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions. Level-of-Service is introduced by HCM to denote the level of quality one can derive from a local under different operation characteristics and traffic volume.
#### HCM model is very useful for the analysis of signalized intersection as it considers all the adjustment factors which are to be taken into account while designing for a signalized I/S.
#### A methodology for analyzing the capacity and level of service (LOS) of signalized intersections is used. 
#### The analysis considers a wide variety of prevailing conditions, including the amount and distribution of traffic movements, traffic composition, geometric characteristics, and details of intersection signalization. 
#### The methodology focuses on the determination of LOS for known or projected conditions. 
#### The capacity analysis methodology for signalized intersections is based on known or projected signalization plans.
#### The primary output of the method is level of service (LOS) 
#### To develop an optimize traffic signal cycle for signalized intersections
#### To Initiate the method for optimizing traffic signals are
#### Minimum cycle,
#### Webster Optimum cycle, and
#### Enumerative method/Algorithm method
#### Synchronization is a method used to improve the level of service of the junction, looking for decreased delay
#### The goal is to switch on the green light when the vehicles approach the intersection. 
#### In the ideal condition no vehicle has to be stopped, avoiding the delay; but in the real situation the several nodes, which represent the junctions, are not at the same distance.
#### They can be considered two different types of synchronization;
 #### • Ideal synchronization (only possible if the junctions had the same spacing A and the 	flow was under a certain value, without variations among the artery);
 #### • Maximum Bandwidth Problem;
